# ConUHacks USSA

USSA was inspired by the desire to revolutionize education through personalized learning experiences.
USSA, Ur Smart Study Assistant, customizes study materials based on individual learning styles for a more effective and enjoyable learning journey.


We built it using Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and Python, Numpy, Panda and Kaggle for the AI/ML. USSA is a user-friendly web application.


Overcoming the challenge of integrating the learning style questionnaire and ensuring seamless user experience posed initial hurdles.


Successfully implementing a responsive and visually appealing interface, and integrating personalized learning features, are achievements we take pride in.


This project taught us the importance of user-centric design and the technicalities involved in building a personalized learning platform.


The next steps involve refining the learning style prediction algorithm, shorten the questionnaire, and incorporating user feedback for continuous improvement with the newsletter.
